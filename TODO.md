# To do:

* integrate servlets from metrics library
* identify & integrate Sling metrics / health checks
* identify & integrate CQ metrics / health checks
* improve config options - e.g.
  * whitelistening components within the timer filter
  * improve OSGi event generatable metrics - not everything available yet
* verify Graphite connection - doesn't look like every event gets transmitted. UDP to blame or ...?
